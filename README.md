<a href="https://bricklayerdotorg.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Bricklayer</a> is a non-propfit with a mission
to actively contribute to the creation of an environment in which education in 
computational thinking, computer science, math, art and the development of spatial 
abilities can be achieved across the K12 spectrum (and beyond) using educational 
models that are engaging, effective, sustainable and scalable.

<strong>Using Vitruvia and Bricklayer-Lite in the Browser</strong></br>
Vitruvia and Bricklayer-Lite use the idea of coding the location of digital legos in both 2 and 3 
dimensions in the browser. By first working through built in lessons with 
<a href="http://wintercoding.com/vitruvia_New/main.html#concepts/1/1">Vitruvia</a> and then applying
what you've learned and your own creativity in
<a href="https://bricklayer-lite.appspot.com/static/index.html" target="_blank">Bricklayer-Lite.</a>

<strong>Coding with Bricklayer</strong></br>
Bricklayer expands on what you learned and used in Vitruvia and Bricklayer-Lite. 
Begin by downloading Bricklayer for <a href="https://bricklayerdotorg.wordpress.com/mac-os-download/" target="_blank">Mac</a>
or <a href="https://bricklayerdotorg.wordpress.com/windows-download/" target="_blank">PC</a> and being coding within
the Bricklayer environment. The code created in Bricklayer is then rendered in Lego Digital Designer (LDD)
or LDraw and you will need to download either (or both) of these at the links provided above. Note: LDraw can handle
much larger builds than LDD.

Objects coded in Bricklayer can also be uploaded into
Minecraft, and steps to do so can be found <a href="https://bricklayerdotorg.wordpress.com/minecraft-download/" target="_blank">
here</a> or 3D printed, steps are outlined in the documentation for Level 4 below.
